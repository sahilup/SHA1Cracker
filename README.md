# SHA1Cracker
This Python script is designed to crack SHA1 hashes using a dictionary attack. It takes a SHA1 hash input from the user and compares it against a provided dictionary file containing a list of common passwords. If a match is found, the corresponding plaintext password is displayed.

# Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run the script using the command python Sha1Cracker.py.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the SHA1 hash and select the dictionary file.
5. The script will attempt to crack the hash and display the result if successful.
